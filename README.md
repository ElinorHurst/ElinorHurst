- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElinorHurst
- 👀 I’m interested in: anything Java and reading books :).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... yes, just learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on useful Java projects with fun team members.  Actually, I've just subscribed so I'm go to be looking around before I can actually say anything truly meaningful here. 
- 📫 How to reach me... I'll share when I'm ready.
